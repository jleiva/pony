// Put your custom js here. If it's not working, that's likely because you haven't used Drupal-specific special functions. Meh. Sorry, you'll have to go look those up.

// For jQuery, you need this:

(function ($) {
  $(document).ready(function(){
  	
    // Put your jQuery functions here
    // and here
    
  });
})(jQuery);
