I made this theme because I've been rolling my own Drupal theme from scratch for every new site for a while now. And I've used the same tricks over and over enough that it's time to bake them into a base theme. I figured I'd put it in a public repository so you can take a peek or use it for your own project.

I don't claim this is The Best Drupal Theme For All Websites Evar. There is a lot of competition in the Drupal base theme world right now, with multiple people claiming their theme theme is Teh Bestest Most 960ResponsiveHTML5FancyBuzzWordNerdyness. (How something can be both 960-grid and responsive beats me, but I guess it makes for a better sales pitch.) If you want a clickable interface for assigning content to dozens of regions in pre-configured responsive layouts, then checkout the [many](http://drupal.org/project/omega) [themes](http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme) [available](http://drupal.org/project/themes) that do that.

Pony doesn't have any of that. It's designed for people writing their own custom responsive layout CSS, and therefore doesn't have all the overhead, weight and cost of those other themes. Instead of being flexible enough to be all-things-to-all-sites, Pony focuses on being a tool for web professionals who want simple markup. You can use Pony as a parent theme for your custom-coded site, or even better, as a jumping-off point for hacking directly as you create your own codebase. Mostly this project reflects hundreds of hours of research, and over a year of punching Drupal 7 in the HTML5 face, trying to get it to behave. If you want shortcuts to what I discovered, then download away! 

What I've learned is that Drupal is a total pain in the ass if you want your site's source code to be simple, fast, semantic and modern. It's markup is verbose and unsemantic, and much of the HTML is hardcoded deep inside Drupal where it's very hard to change. I think this is a problem. I want the sites I build to be sleek. I want the same level of quality results that I could get from creating simple HTML templates for another CMS or framework. And I want that for *Drupal,* because otherwise Drupal is pretty awesome. So this project is on a mission to get Drupal to stop doing all that drupally-crap to the HTML. It also represents my personal understanding of many 2012 best practices according to the world's best designers and developers, and my translation of those best practices into Drupal.
