This is a base theme for Drupal 7, created by Jen Simmons.
I can't give you a unicorn, but I can give you one pony.™


I made this theme because I've been rolling my own Drupal theme from scratch for every new site for a while now. And I've used the same tricks over and over enough that it's time to bake them into a base theme. When you are still learning Drupal, it's best to build on top of someone else's code. Once you gain enough mastery, try creating your own theme  from scratch. I think there's real value — especially when best practices are evolving so quickly right now — in rolling your own tools, and questioning each line of code. But maybe you don't have time for that. Or maybe you want to just take a peek at what I'm thinking. Meanwhile, I am putting all of my current practices in one place to make the work I do go faster.

I don't claim this is The Best Drupal Theme For All Websites Evar. There is a lot of competition in the Drupal base theme world right now, with multiple people claiming their theme theme is the best, that it's all 960responsivehtml5fancybuzzwords. (How something can be both a 960-grid and responsive beats me, but I guess it makes for a better sales pitch.) I don't wish to jump into that pool. Use this if you like. Don't if you don't. If you disagree with my choices, that's nice, go make your own base theme. This is not an invitation for you jackals to start arguing with me. Mostly this reflects hundreds of hours of research, and over a year of punching Drupal 7 in the face, trying to get it to behave. If you want a shortcut to what I discovered, then welcome! 

What I know for sure is that Drupal is a total pain in the ass if you want your site's front-end to be clean, fast, responsive, semantic, and modern. The default markup is verbose and unsemantic, and much of the HTML is hardcoded deep inside Drupal where it's very hard to change. Many people in the Drupal community don't think this is a problem; they think web standards are overblown and unimportant. Whatever. I think it's a problem. I want the sites I build to be sleek. This project represents my personal understanding of many of the 2012 best practices according to some of the world's best designers and developers. 

This theme is not designed to be used from the Drupal administration interface. If you want a clickable interface for setting up your responsive website, then checkout the several themes available that can help you do that. http://drupal.org/project/themes This theme is best used as a parent theme for a custom-coded site, or even better, as a starting place for you to hack up and use directly as your codebase. Good luck with writing your own code!
