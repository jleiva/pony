### This is a base theme for Drupal 7, created by Jen Simmons.  
*I can't give you a unicorn, but I can give you one pony.™*


I made this theme because I've been rolling my own Drupal theme from scratch for every new site for a while now. And I've used the same tricks over and over enough that it's time to bake them into a base theme. When you are still learning Drupal, it's best to build on top of someone else's code. Once you gain enough mastery, try creating your own theme  from scratch. I think there's real value — especially when best practices are evolving so quickly right now — in rolling your own tools, and questioning each line of code. But maybe you don't have time for that. Or maybe you want to just take a peek at what I'm thinking. Meanwhile, I am putting all of my current practices in one place to make the work I do go faster.

I don't claim this is The Best Drupal Theme For All Websites Evar. There is a lot of competition in the Drupal base theme world right now, with multiple people claiming their theme theme is Teh Bestest, the most 960ResponsiveHTML5FancyBuzzWordyness. (How something can be both 960-grid and responsive beats me, but I guess it makes for a better sales pitch.) If you want a clickable interface for assigning how your responsive website will be responsive, then checkout the [many](http://drupal.org/project/omega) [themes](http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme) [available](http://drupal.org/project/themes) that can help you do that. I believe that's what the strengths of those other projects are — you don't need to write as much code because they've pre-build and included multiple options for you, along with complex UI tools for configuration. Pony doesn't have any of that. It's designed for web professionals who are writing their own custom responsive layout CSS anyway, and therefore it does not have all the overhead, weight and cost of those other themes. You can use Pony as a parent theme for your custom-coded site, or even better, as a jumping-off point for hacking directly as you create your own codebase. 

Mostly this project reflects hundreds of hours of research, and over a year of punching Drupal 7 in the HTML5 face, trying to get it to behave. If you want shortcuts to what I discovered, then download away! 

What I've learned is that Drupal is a total pain in the ass if you want your site's source code to be simple, fast, semantic and modern. It's markup is verbose and unsemantic, and much of the HTML is hardcoded deep inside Drupal where it's very hard to change. I think this is a problem. I want the sites I build to be sleek. I want the same level of quality results that I could get from creating simple HTML templates for another CMS or framework. And I want that for *Drupal,* because otherwise Drupal is pretty awesome. So this project is on a mission to get Drupal to stop doing all that drupally-crap to the HTML. And it represents my personal understanding of many of the 2012 best practices according to some of the world's best designers and developers, and my translation of those best practices into Drupal.
