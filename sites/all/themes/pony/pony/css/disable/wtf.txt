Why are there empty CSS files sitting here? (With no matching SASS files?)To save Drupal from making extras http requests. 

Every time you list a css file in a Drupal theme's .info file, Drupal will attempt to load that file instead of loading any file of the same name from Drupal core or from any module. It's a neat trick. Do you hate all the code in system.menus.css? They just list it a file with that name in the .info file, and none of the code from core's system.menus.css will be loaded.

Problem is, apparently if you just list the files, Drupal keep looking for it, making an http request to get the file every time a page is loaded. By listing some empty files here instead, we can prevent that http request. Which makes the site load faster â€” significantly faster on some devices/browsers.
